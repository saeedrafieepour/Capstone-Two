# Capstone Two Project
# Loan default prediction

## Problem Statement: Whether or not an applicant would fail to pay back its loan fully at the time of application having the data from the payment status of the current customers?

#### LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company: 
A.	Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:  
•	Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate).  
•	Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.  
•	Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan.  
B.	Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company.  

#### Identifying the customers who are prone to default their loan ensures the company to enhance its financial standing. Failure in approving those who do not have the required qualifications and rejecting the applications who are eligible for the loans result in financial losses. Developing an accurate predictive model is required for the success of applicant’s screening. 

#### The primary goal of this project is to predict if a loan applicant would fail to pay back its loan fully at the time of application. Therefore, only features available during application are considered in modeling.

####  The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle website. The dataset has 2,260,701 observations of loans granted between 2007 to 2018 with 151 features which include information about applicants such as credit score, income, and employment, as well as data about loans, such as their amounts, and terms.
